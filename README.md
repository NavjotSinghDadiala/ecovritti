# Full-Stack Starter Structure

This project provides a **ready-to-use** that I can quickly import whenever I start a new full-stack project. It keeps the setup simple while leaving room for scaling later.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Jinja, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)  
- **Database:** SQLite (PostgreSQL planned for later)
